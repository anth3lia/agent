# Building Agentic Workflows on AWS

This workshop is designed for builders ready to create Agentic Workflows on AWS. Agentic Workflows enable large language models (LLMs) to act autonomously, performing tasks or providing assistance on behalf of users.

In this workshop, you'll learn to:

1. Leverage capabilities in Amazon Bedrock to create both chatbot and non-chatbot workflows
2. Incorporate features such as code interpreter, guardrails, knowledge bases and more!
3. Use Amazon Q Developer to assist in coding and debugging
